# AnalogClockJS
My first Javascript project. Analog Clock that can be used on any website.

It seemed a bit ambitious in the beginning considering how many new concepts I was introduced to but I found the development on this project to be straight forward.
The HTML and CSS was provided as this was a Javascript excercise. The clock updates every second and checks real time according to the browsers default time. 

First time using an SVG Image
Used methods to get the current time
Used Variables to hold those times/information
Used methods to turn the variables into minute, hand, seconds
Used operators to change variables to degrees for the circle
Used DOM elements to position the hands
